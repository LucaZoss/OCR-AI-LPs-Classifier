important crossroads. For centuries, whoever occupied
the passes of the Hindu Kush ruled the doorway to India
and China. Persians, Indians, Turks, and Mongols all have
their kin in this country and have had their influence upon
the character and culture of the Afghans. The Afghans
are proud of their heritage, especially of such national
traits as honesty, hospitality, and friendliness. The music
of Afghanistan is deeply rooted in tradition and folklore
and it is very much alive in the hearts of the people. It is
an essential part of their life, and a colorful expression of

the national temperament.

Traditional Afghan and Near-Eastern music were
brought to the Indian subcontinent by Islamic rulers and
strongly influenced the local classical music. North Indian
music owes some of its instruments to the land on the
other side of the Hindu Kush. Nowadays a certain amount
of feedback is noticeable: the music of Afghanistan shows
the impact of Indian and Pakistani film music, which in
its turn has absorbed Western styles. Yet despite the in-
fluences of these foreign styles, Afghan music has pre-
served its unique character.

Among those who have helped shape the style heard
on the present disc are musicians such as Ustad Qasem
(grandfather of Musa Kasimi, who is heard in this re-
cording). After studying with his father, a famous court
singer, he completed his musical education in India and
then returned to Kabul, where he collected folk music and
encouraged composition in new national styles. Musi-
cians such as those heard here keep these trends alive.
They do not reject foreign elements altogether, preferring
to blend them with Afghan themes in such a way that the
local flavor is preserved. Another important figure in
Afghan music is Ustad Mohamed Omar, robab-player and
composer, who plays the robab solos on many of the
selections presented here, including two of his own in-

strumental compositions (Side one, band 5; Side two,
band 3). His style exerts an audible influence upon the
younger performers around him.

The other performers presented here are among the
cream of Radio Afghanistan performers and represent the
mainstream of the radio style. Here, Indian musical in-
struments and film music have meshed with Afghan folk
styles in a unique blend. One must also allow for the
impact of the popular music of neighboring Iran and
Soviet Central Asia, but until quite recently Western
musical influence had been at an absolute minimum.

PETER TEN HOOPEN

Among the instruments heard in this album:

The robab is a true Afghan instrument also used widely
in the Pashtun areas of Pakistan, in Kashmir, and in some
parts of northern India; it is the ancestor of the Indian
sarod. The four main playing strings are gut, struck with
a plectrum, There are also a large number of sympathetic
strings. The robab may be related to lute-type instru-
ments depicted on reliefs of the Gandharan (Greco-
Buddhist) Period of Afghan art (ca. 2nd century A.D.).

The tanbur is also a lute of Afghan origin. It has two
main wire strings struck with a wire plectrum and nu-
merous metal sympathetic strings, producing a metallic
timbre. Other instruments such as the sarinda and sarangi
relate more to the Indian world. The former is popular in
the eastern and southern provinces of Afghanistan among
Pashtuns. In the case of both the sarinda and the sarangi
the strings are not pressed against the Angee
playing, as with the Western violin, but resonate free ip

Another “imported” instrument is the santur, @ pee
hammered dulcimer native to Persia. It is also used in the
Punjab, Kashmir, and parts of North India. The strings are

SIDE ONE (17:40)

1. Nan mai. dowrai.a.wolei.(Today, 1 saw her) (4:18)

Gul Zaman, singer

Language: Pashto Style: Peshawar

A folk song, very loosely rhymed.

Today, from a distance, I saw her, my Leila, rambling
along near the brook. Dressed in red, she moves like
a flame, like a proud pigeon, strutting, cooing to her
beauty. When closer, her black eyes, beneath flutter-
ing lashes, were shining, her lips so bright a red! her
face, radiant white; her words! Today as she passed
by, I caught a glimpse, her face half-hidden by her
flowing black hair. A smile was all I saw as she
passed by, nurtured on tender care, my Leila. How
many hearts does she hold in her henna’d hands!

2. Mohammed dai nabiyano (Mohammed among prophets)
(Eke po SSG Gan QAP >
Ustad Doray Logari, singer
Language: Pashto Style: Kabul
A formal ode in classical Middle-Eastern style, called
qasida. When dedicated to the Prophet, a qasida is
called na’t.

Mohammed is a prince among prophets; on Judg-
ment Day he hears sinners beg forgiveness. Thou
wert created from light, oh Prophet, and received
into heaven’s highest places. Hail, oh hail, hail
Prophet, hail oh Prophet. Mohammed is a prince
among prophets. To thee Gabriel brought God's de-
cree, the Koran. Through God’s words in the Book
thou showed man Right. To the heavens God invited
thee, His beloved.

3, BimGr dil, kharab dil (Heartsick and sad) _ (3:35)
Hamida Rokhshana, singer whist - clerd JAy
Language: Dari Style: Herat
A ghazal in the classical style originating in the 10th
century and perfected in Afghanistan and Iran cen-
turies ago. Ghazal, sometimes equated with “sonnet,”
is a poetic form intended to be sung. The poet who
composes a ghazal always includes his pen-name in the
last verse. Thus we know the author of this sonnet to be
Ostowar — meaning “steadfast.”

Sick, ruined, and enfeebled is my heart; it bleeds
from the cruelties of the beauties of the time. Dusk
to dawn, sleep evades my eyes, O Allah, because of
the sobs and wails of my heart. Among all the fair-
faced ones, O winner of hearts, who appeared in
time, my heart chose you. Since Ostowar became a
slave of your love, no longer does his heart race
after this one and that one.

4, Dur az to az shab_ ta sahar (Fas from you) (3:47) ae
~ Aap, Chawtade ovr belt DAKO pve

Zhila, singer

Language: Dari Style: Kabul

A sonnet (ghazal) of which only the first portion is sung

here. The opening verse, matla’, is repeated as chorus.
When far from you, from dusk to dawn, I'm a weeping

beads encircle her neck, on her mouth lipstick, her
face adorned with beauty marks, under her blouse
two pomegranates, hurrying toward a rendezvous

but oh God, no matter, poverty is also fate!

. Chard jafa mekoni ay dilbar (Lovers’ complaint) (5:55)

Setara Nahid, Musa Kasimi, singers

Language: Dari Style: Kabul

A sonnet (ghazal) composed by Ostowar. This second

sonnet by the poet works his pen-name into the last

verse even more effectively, because the uninitiated

would think it a reference only to the word “steadfast.”
Heartless and cruel you are to me, enchantress of my
poor heart. Meaningless complaints do you no good;
you are so cruel, oh my love. Behold these eyes. they
witness your cruelty. Meaningless complaints do you
no good; you are so cruel, oh my love. Rare blue
narcissus are your eyes, troubling, disturbing my
peace. The beauty of your sweet lament pierces my
corroded heart. Your flowing hair, flying so free, has
set my heart all aflight. Away from you there can be
nought for me but the hour of Doomsday. In seeking
your love, I’m nothing if not steadfast — faithful and
true will I be till Resurrection Day.

Let me be near you, oh my love, to die near you, oh
beloved, of a tormented heart. By your love I am
wounded, Oh handsome slayer, by your unkind dag-
ger let me die. This candle burns for you; alas not
unable to light your face, I melt
