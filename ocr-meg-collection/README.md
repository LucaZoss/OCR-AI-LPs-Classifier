## Project Overview

Hi there! This is a project overview of a tool created to help me do Vinyl LPs catalog labelling within my switzerland citizen labourship (kind of swiss military service.)

üéØ **Project Objective** 

The goal of this application was to optimize the time used for labelling the collection inside the MEG museum (ethno-musicologie department).

The initial situation was to do this work manually, making on average from 8 to 10 LPs per day (~1.5hour per LP). This project aims to reduce this work to 20minutes per object. (Making it 5.5x faster!‚ö°Ô∏è) (This calculation is taking into account human feedbacks in the loop.)
