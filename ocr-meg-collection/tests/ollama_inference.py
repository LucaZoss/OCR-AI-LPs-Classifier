    You are given the extracted text from the OCR process of a vinyl record's cover. The OCR text may contain errors such as cut-off words, missing characters, or incorrect formatting. Your task is to identify and extract specific pieces of information from this text, correcting these errors where possible, and present the information in a structured JSON format. The output should include general information about the vinyl (LP), details about each track, and any relevant notes.

    Instructions:

    1. General Information:
    - LP_ID: Extract the ID of the LP, which always starts with "LP" followed by a 4-digit number.
    - Title: Extract the title of the LP, typically found on the front cover.
    - Subtitle: If present, extract the subtitle of the LP.
    - Performer: Extract the full names of the performers or artists involved, separated by a semicolon if multiple.
    - Publisher: Extract the name of the publisher (company or organization responsible for the release).
    - Publishing Year: Identify the publishing year of the LP if mentioned.
    - Label Company: Extract the name of the label company.
    - Label Number: Identify the unique label identifier, usually appearing after the label company's name.
    - Language: Determine the language used in the text (e.g., Spanish).
    - Recording Info: Extract information about where or by whom the LP was recorded, if available.
    - Other Information: Include any other relevant information that doesn't fall into the above categories.
    - Genre/Style: Determine the genre or style of the album if mentioned, sometimes found in parentheses '()' after the track names.
    - Notes: Extract any additional notes or contextual information found on the cover that may provide insights into the album's content or production.

    2. Track Information:
    For each track, extract the following details:
    - Face: Determine whether the track is on Face "A" or "B".
    - Track_Number: Correctly identify the track's number or position in the list. If the track numbers are concatenated or split incorrectly, infer the correct order.
    - Track_Name: Correctly extract the name of the track. If parts of the name are cut off or incorrectly joined with other text, attempt to infer the full name.
    - Track_Composer: Extract the composerâ€™s name, which may follow the track name (e.g., Jose Fernandez, Dpto. del Folklore).
    - Track_Length: Extract the track length if mentioned.

    3. Error Handling:
    - When you encounter cut-off words or concatenated track names/numbers, make an educated guess to reconstruct the proper names and numbers.
    - If the track numbers are listed in a format such as "1, 2, TrackName1, TrackName2", correctly separate and assign the track numbers to the respective track names.
